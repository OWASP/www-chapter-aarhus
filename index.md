The Aarhus local chapter organises bi-monthly events to promote OWASP and information security in general.

## Important: We've moved from Meetup

**OWASP Global is retiring Meetup as of January 31, 2026** due to significant price increases. [Read the announcement](https://owasp.org/blog/2026/01/13/retiring-meetup.html).

OWASP Aarhus continues as usual - we just use a new registration system.
