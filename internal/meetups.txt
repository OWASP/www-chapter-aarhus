Overskrift 
4 tools to test and increase a company's cyber security posture.

About the presentation 
IT Security is sometimes considered a nuisance, expensive, complicated and hard to improve. In this presentation I will show 4 different tools which are fairly easy to use and can help you significantly increase your resilience to cyber attacks. 
The tools are Nessus, PingCastle, BloodHound and CIS Benchmarks. The presentation is primarily a live demo of each of these tools, while I explain how they work and how they can be used by you as a company, an employee, or external consultant. This should allow you to both test and increase a company's cyber security posture and the reduce the risk and consequence of cyber attack such as ransomware.
