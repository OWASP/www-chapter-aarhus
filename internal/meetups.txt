Overskrift 
4 tools to test and increase a company's cyber security posture.

About the presentation 
IT Security is sometimes considered a nuisance, expensive, complicated and hard to improve. In this presentation I will show 4 different tools which are fairly easy to use and can help you significantly increase your resilience to cyber attacks. 
The tools are Nessus, PingCastle, BloodHound and CIS Benchmarks. The presentation is primarily a live demo of each of these tools, while I explain how they work and how they can be used by you as a company, an employee, or external consultant. This should allow you to both test and increase a company's cyber security posture and the reduce the risk and consequence of cyber attack such as ransomware.

Title: “Code scanning with CodeQL: Early, automatic, developer-friendly detection of security vulnerabilities in code”

Speaker: Karl Krukow, Director of Software Engineering at GitHub

About the presentation
This talk is an introduction to GitHub code scanning with CodeQL. Code scanning is part of GitHub’s new Advanced Security products. We will give an overview of how code scanning integrates in the developer workflow, and allows automatic detection of security vulnerabilities in code before it hits production. We will also touch upon how security researchers can perform security (variant) analysis on multiple code-bases in parallel to detect new vulnerabilities at scale.

About Karl:
Karl leads a group of engineers building GitHub code scanning. Before joining GitHub, Karl worked at the startup Xamarin on Xamarin Test Cloud, and co-founded LessPainful, a mobile test automation start-up which created the popular open-source mobile test framework, Calabash. Karl graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from University of Aarhus in 2006 and worked several years as a senior consultant before co-founding LessPainful.
